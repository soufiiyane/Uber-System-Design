# Uber-System-Design

## Introduction
The ride-sharing system is designed to facilitate transportation by providing a platform for users to request rides, connect with drivers, ensure secure payments, and manage ride-related activities seamlessly. This document outlines the specifications, functionalities, and technical details of the system.

## Problem Statement
### Scalability in Payment Processing
Handling concurrent payment transactions efficiently as the user base grows is a primary challenge. The system needs to process a high volume of payments simultaneously while ensuring reliability, security, and minimal downtime.

### Real-time Notifications
Providing timely notifications to users about ride status updates, driver assignments, and payment confirmations is crucial. Real-time delivery of these notifications ensures a seamless user experience.

### Efficient Vehicle Management
Efficiently managing different vehicle types and dynamically creating them based on user demand presents a challenge. A scalable system should allow easy addition and management of new vehicle types within the platform.

## Purposes
### Scalable Payment Processing
Addressing the scalability issue by implementing a Payment Gateway using the Strategy Pattern. This allows interchangeability of payment methods (PayPal, credit cards, Stripe) while ensuring scalability and easy integration of new options.

### Real-time Notifications with Observer Pattern
Achieving real-time notifications by implementing the Observer Pattern. Notifications are triggered by ride status updates and efficiently delivered to relevant users, enhancing the user experience and ride visibility.

### Dynamic Vehicle Creation with Factory Pattern
Utilizing the Factory Pattern to dynamically create different vehicle types based on user demand. The VehicleFactory manages the creation process, allowing scalability and easy addition of new vehicle types.

## Roles and Functionalities
### User Roles
- **Rider:** Requests rides, tracks ride status, makes payments, and provides feedback.
- **Driver:** Accepts ride requests, navigates to pick-up locations, completes rides, and receives payments.

### Functionalities
- **User Management:** Handles registration, login, profile management, and access control.
- **Ride Request Handling:** Manages ride requests, assigns drivers, and tracks ride statuses.
- **Payment Processing:** Facilitates secure and scalable payment transactions using different payment methods.
- **Real-time Notifications:** Sends timely notifications to users regarding ride updates.
- **Vehicle Management:** Dynamically creates and manages various types of vehicles available for rides.
- **Feedback and Rating:** Allows users to rate and provide feedback based on their experiences.

## Design Patterns Utilized
- **Strategy Pattern (Payment):** Provides a scalable and interchangeable payment processing mechanism.
- **Observer Pattern (Notifications):** Enables real-time notification delivery to users.
- **Factory Pattern (Vehicle Creation):** Dynamically creates and manages different vehicle types.

## Conclusion
The architecture designed to address scalability challenges in payment processing, offer real-time notifications, and ensure efficient vehicle management. By leveraging various design patterns and functionalities and solid design principles, the system aims to provide a seamless and scalable platform for both riders and drivers, enhancing the overall user experience and service reliability.
